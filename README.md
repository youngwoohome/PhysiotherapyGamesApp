# UCL RemotePhysiotherapy in Microsoft Teams
RemotePhysiotherapy is a Teams Application, designed and built with brand new technologies. 
The aim of our app is to provide a platform for remote physiotherapy. 
A platform that is accessible for all; carving a new path for remote physiotherapy. 
We hope this application will be used in unison with both MotionInput and our MotionInput NDI solution. 
This project was developed using the Teams Toolkit.

Also has a framework, so if you want to use the structure defined, it will be easy to implement LiveShare on other 1 button static games.
